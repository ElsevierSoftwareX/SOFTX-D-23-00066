:code:`watex` is under-review in `computers and geosciences journal <https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/computers-and-geosciences/>`_ for a scientific publication. 
However, we appreciate to cite the paper implementing watex in a case history software below if the software is used in any scientific publication.
It has been published in the `Water Resources Research journal <https://doi.org/10.1029/2021wr031623>`_.
Here is a ready-made BibTeX entry:

In most situations where :code:`watex` is cited, a citation to `scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`_ would also be appropriate.
