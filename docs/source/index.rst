============================================================

`watex` is a Python package to bring a piece of solution faced with engineering problems encountered in the groundwater exploration (GWE) field. It uses 
some electrical, logging and hydrogeology parameters combined with the machine learning methods to predict some water content targets such as 
the flow rate and the costly hydrogeological parameters(e.g. the permeabilty coefficient `k` related to the water inrush). `watex` expects contributing in 
the `Sustainable Development Goals n6 <https://unric.org/en/sdg-6/>`_  and the `Africa-Union Agenda 2063n1 <https://au.int/en/agenda2063/flagship-projects>`_ 
achievements for the rural and urban population welfare. To read more about the ideas behind the design of the package, check the :ref:`introductory notes <about>` instead. To get started with 
the package, you can visit the :ref:`installation page <installation>` to see how to download it. You can also browse the 
:ref:`user guide <user_guide>` to go deeper in the different methods implemented ( geology, geophysical and hydrogeology)  
supported by theories and concrete examples. To find out with `watex`, visit the :ref:`API reference <api_ref>`. Finally, you can 
flip through the :doc:`examples <examples>` to see some of expected results you can get using the software. To have a look about the 
package organization, refer to the :ref:`structure <structure>` documentation.
