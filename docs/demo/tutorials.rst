Overview 
===========


Here are some code snippets implemented in Jupyter notebook to quick showing how to use :code:`watex`. It is composed 
of : 

* `Quick visualization` 
	Is for quick :class:`~watex.view.plot.QuickPlot`, tensors :class:`~watex.view.plot.TPlot` plot 
	and exploratory :class:`~watex.view.plot.Explot` plot. These are not an exhaustive plots. For a deep exploration 
	visualization , refer to :ref:`api_references`. 
 
* `DC-EM methods` 
	Gives a fast and visual depiction of how to handle the DC-resistivity and EM data using :class:`~watex.methods.electrical` and 
	:class:`~watex.methods.em` modules. 
* `Hydro method` 
	Gives an overview of predicting the permeaibility coefficient `k` from the hydrogeophysical data. It entails predicting the 
	naive groups of aquifer NGA before applying the Mixture Learning Strategy (MXS).
