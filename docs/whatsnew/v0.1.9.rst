v0.1.9 (March 15, 2023)
--------------------------

This is a minor change performed from ``v0.1.8`` and adaptations.  

- Fix negative resistivity generation in :term:`VES` from :func:`watex.datasets.make_ves`. 
  Use absolute instead.

- Set a slice components property `_c_` as  a :class:`watex.view.TPlot` attribute used by all 
  related methods.
