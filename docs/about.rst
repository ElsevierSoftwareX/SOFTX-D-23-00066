About
==========

Here are some introductory notes about the mission and the goals of the package. 


Mission
=========

`watex <https://github.com/WEgeophysics/watex/>`_ mission is `to propose intelligent exploration methods based on artificial intelligence in the GWE field`. Indeed, the package 
deals with the geophysical (DC resistivity profiling & sounding, Electromagnetic for short-periods (Natural Audio-freqency magnetotellurics)), 
logging and hydrogeology methods. The modules are written to intend solving real-engineering problems and will 
grow in future release as the challenges are enormeous especially in the GWE field.   


Goals
========
Being open-source, the :code:`watex` expects to help academicians and companies working in the GWE field to achieve the following goals:

* reducing the unsuccessful and unsustainable boreholes during the DWSC by predicting FR before any drilling operations. 
* minimizing the failure of pumping tests by predicting in advance the permeability coefficient k. Furthermore, it should be an alternative way for geosciences engineers to accurately define the depth of the existing underground aquifer, to find the depth to start and end the pumping test. 
* proposing a fast and efficient solution in the processing of short-period electromagnetic data especially the NSAMT to locate the conductive zone for the drilling operations after the EM survey. 
* especially participating in the `SDG-n6`_  and the Africa-Union `Agenda-2063-n1`_  achievements for the rural and urban population welfare. 
* globally providing a better future by putting a little smile on children faces of families from poorest regions of the world and Africa in particular. This is possible by helping to achieve the wide program of `"WATER4ALL"`.

Benefits
===========

:code:`watex` has been used to solve real-engineering problem, such as the FR prediction 
during the campaigns for drinking water supply. It aims computing some geoelectrical parameters 
using the DC-resistivity methods (Resistivity Profiling and vertical sounding) and used the 
`Support vector machines` for the FR prediction with a success rate greater than 77% . The case history is published in 
`Water Resources Research`_ journal known as one of the most popular journal in the GWE field research.

Furthermore, :code:`watex` is designed using the Python language because of its easy accessibility, clear syntax and interactive shell environment. Secondly, 
Python is freely distributed and with the powerful numerical libraries (`NumPy <https://numpy.org>`_ , `SciPy <https://scipy.org>`_ , 
`Pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org>`_ , `SQLite <https://sqlite.org/index.html>`_ , `scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn.org/stable>`_ , 
etc.), to handle a large data sets.
