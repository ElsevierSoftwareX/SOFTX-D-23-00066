About
==========

Here are some introductory notes about the mission and the goals of the package. 

Mission
=========

`watex <https://github.com/WEgeophysics/watex/>`_ mission is to propose intelligent exploration methods based on 
artificial intelligence in the GWE field. Indeed, the package deals with the geophysical 
(DC resistivity profiling & sounding, Electromagnetic for short periods (Natural Audio-frequency magnetotellurics(NSAMT)), 
logging and hydrogeology methods. The modules are written to intend solving real-engineering problems and will grow in 
a future release as the challenges are enormous, especially in the groundwater exploration (GWE) field.   


Goals
========
Being open-source, the :code:`watex` expects to help academicians and companies working in the GWE field 
to achieve the following goals:

* reducing the unsuccessful and unsustainable boreholes during the drinking water supply campaign (DWSC) by predicting FR before any drilling operations. 
* minimizing the failure of pumping tests by predicting in advance the permeability coefficient k. Furthermore, it 
  should be an alternative way for geosciences engineers to accurately define the depth of the existing underground aquifer, 
  to find the depth to start and end the pumping test.
* proposing a fast and efficient solution in the processing of short-period electromagnetic data especially the NSAMT to 
  locate the conductive zone for the drilling operations after the EM survey. 
* especially contributing in the `SDG-n6`_  and the Africa-Union `Agenda-2063-n1`_  achievements for the rural and urban 
  population welfare. 
* globally providing a better future by putting a little smile on children's faces of families from the poorest 
  regions of the world and Africa in particular.

Benefits
===========

:code:`watex` has been used to solve a real-engineering problem, such as the FR prediction during the campaigns for 
drinking water supply. It aims to compute some geoelectrical parameters using the DC-resistivity methods 
(Resistivity Profiling and vertical sounding) and used the `Support vector machines for the FR prediction with 
a success rate greater than 77%. The case history is published in `Water Resources Research`_ journal is known 
as one of the most popular journals in the GWE field research.

Furthermore, :code:`watex` is designed using the Python language because of its easy accessibility, 
clear syntax, and interactive shell environment. Secondly, Python is freely distributed and the powerful 
numerical libraries (`NumPy <https://numpy.org>`_ , `SciPy <https://scipy.org>`_ , `Pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org>`_ , `SQLite <https://sqlite.org/index.html>`_ , `scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn.org/stable>`_ , etc.), to handle a large data sets.
