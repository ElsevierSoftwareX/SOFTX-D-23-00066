    `WATex` is a Python library focused on the groundwater exploration field. It brings novel approaches and solutions to minimize losses 
    during hydro-geophysical engineering projects. It uses geophysical methods combined with machine learning approaches 
    to predict some water content targets. More about the ideas behind the library design can be found in the :ref:`introductory notes <about>`.     	
	
    To getting started with the software, refer to the :ref:`installation guide <installation>`. You can also browse 
    the :doc:`examples <glr_examples/index>` page to see some of the expected results you can achieve using the software. 
    The :ref:`user guide <user_guide>` is a more in-depth guide about the different methods implemented supported by theories and real-world examples.
