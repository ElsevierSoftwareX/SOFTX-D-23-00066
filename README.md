**_Special toolbox for WATer EXploration  using Artificial Intelligence Learning methods_**

## Overview

**WATex** is firstly an exploration open source software using AI learning methods for water exploration like underground water research,
 and secondly intend to supply drinking water for regions faced of water scarcity  and finaly involves water sanitation for population welfare by bringing a piece of solution of their daily problems. The aim objective is to participate of 
 [Sustanaible Development Goals N6](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/development-agenda/) achievement which is  `Ensure access to water and sanitation for all`.

## Units used 

1. Apparent resisttivity *rhoaa* in ohm.meter 
2. Standard fracture index *sfi*  ; no unit 
3. Anomaly ratio *ANR* : no unit 
4. Anomaly power *Pa* or *power*  in meter(m) 
5. Anomaly magnitude *Ma* or *magnitude* in ohm.m 
6. Anomaly shape - can be _V, M, K, L, H, C, V and W_ (no unit). 
7. Anomaly type - can be _EC, NC, CB2P and PC_ (no unit)
8. Layer thickness *Thick* in m. 

## Compute geo-electrical features 

Geo-electrical features are mainly use for prediction purposes in the case to estimate the flow. A demo to compute electrical features from _Electrical resistivity profile (ERP)_ can be done as follow:
