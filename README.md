##  Goals and Missions 

**_WATex_** is a Python  package for reducing losses during the hydro-geophysical exploration projects.
  The main objective is, first, to bring a piece of solution in a wide program of  **_WATER4ALL_** such 
   as participating in [Sustanaible Development Goals N6](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/development-agenda/) and [Africa Agenda 2063 N1](https://au.int/en/agenda2063/flagship-projects#)  achievements.
   It encompasses the DC-resistivity ( Electrical profiling (ERP) & vertical electrical sounding (VES)), short-periods EM, geology and hydrogeology parameters calculation methods. 
   It is mainly focused on the field of groundwater exploration. The computing of hydro-geophysical parameters combined with the machine learning methods 
   allow to right locate the drilling operations by predicting the water content in the well and reduce the cost of permeability coefficient (k) collection during the hydro-geophysical engineering projects. 
   This will minimize the numerous unsucessfull drillings, k-data collection, thereby saving money for funders, state governements, geophysical and drilling ventures. 
 

## Documentation 

Visit the [package website](https://watex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more resources. You can also quick browse the software [API reference](https://watex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_references.html)
and flip through the [examples page](https://watex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general_examples.html) to see some of expected results. Furthermore, the 
[step-by-step guide] is elaborated for read-world engineering problems such as computing DC parameters and predicting the k-parameter. For deep implementation, consult the [user guide](https://watex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide.html). 
instead. A concrete example using watex can be found in the published [case history](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2021WR031623) paper.
To conclude, a [wiki page](https://github.com/WEgeophysics/watex/wiki) can also be visited for more curiosity.

## Installation 

**_WATex_** is not available in any distribution platforms yet (PyPI or conda-forge). However, your can install the package from 
source: 
```
git clone https://github.com/WEgeophysics/watex.git 
```
or simply visit the [installation guide](https://watex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) page.
