**_Special toolbox for WATer EXploration  using Artificial Intelligence Learning methods_**

## Overview

**WATex** is firstly an exploration open source software using AI learning methods for water exploration like underground water research,
 and secondly intend to supply drinking water for regions faced of water scarcity  and finaly involves water sanitation for population welfare by bringing a piece of solution of their daily problems. The aim objective is to participate of 
 [Sustanaible Development Goals N6](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/development-agenda/) achievement which is  `Ensure access to water and sanitation for all`.
