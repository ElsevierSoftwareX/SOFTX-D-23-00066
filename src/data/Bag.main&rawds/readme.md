# Groundater flow prediction using support vector machines : Bagoue region  dataset, North part of Cote d'Ivoire " 

 *** Cote d'Ivoire is french speaking country then most of data guidelines are written in French.***
 *** Data are collected during the Presidential Emmergency Program(PPU), National Program of Drinking Water Supply(PNAEP) and other geophysical locals firms.***

**Overview 

These are are collected during 	PANEP project , PPU and other particular firms
the IP folder contains of preporcessing vertical electrical sounding of survey area set 
the ERT folder contain at the same time , the ERT data and the VES raw data 
The selected point for drilling are most likely highligthed or spoecified on ERT curve.

Coordinates are not the real coordinates of the area to keep the ` private contents of each survey locations`

Most of the sites are nammed by their code "b" + "index values".

**NOTE** : the main file used  to implement codes after computed anomalies features [`quatitatives params` and `qualitatives param` ] 
is `_bagoue_civ_loc_ves&erpdata.csv` files.
