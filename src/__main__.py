ðŸ’§ Machine Learning Research Package for Hydrogeophysic 
======================================================

Originally called *WAT-er EX-ploration using AI learning methods*, `WATex`_ is
an open-source package entirely written in Python to bring a piece of solution 
in the field of groundwater exploration (GWE) in a wide program of WATER4ALL and
for the Sustanaible Development Goals N6 achievement( `SDGn6`_ ). And, packages 
and modules are written to solve real-engineering problems in the field of GWE. 
Currently, it deals with the differents methods: 
    
    * geophysical (from DC-Electrical to Electromagnetic) 
    * hydrogeology (from drilling to  parameters calculation)
    * geology (for stratigraphic model generation)
    
All methods mainly focus on the  field of groundwater explorations. One of 
the main advantage using `WATex`_ is the use of machine learning methods in the 
hydrogeophysic parameter predictions to minimize the risk of unsucessfull 
drillings and the hugely reduce the cost of the hydrogeology parameter 
collections.
