# Even if empty this file is useful so that when running from the root folder
# ./watex is added to sys.path by pytest. See
# https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/explanation/pythonpath.html for more
# details. For example, this allows to build extensions in place and run pytest
# docs/api/methods.rst and use watex from the local folder rather than
# the one from site-packages.
