# Code of Conduct

WATex is not reached the high level of open sources libraries powered by many contributors yet. 
However, we probably expect contributors with a diversity of skills to this project to make the  
software attain high standard level and a more attractive framework in the groundwater exploration field. 

Therefore, as well as friendly and didactic discussions, we aspire to treat everybody equally, and value their contributions.
Decisions should be are made based on technical relevant idea and contribution in geosciences and watex exploration.

Code is not the only way to help the project. Reviewing pull requests,
answering questions to help others on mailing lists or issues, organizing and
teaching tutorials, working on the website, improving the documentation, are
all priceless contributions.


We abide by the principles of openness, respect, and consideration of others of
the Python Software Foundation: https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/
