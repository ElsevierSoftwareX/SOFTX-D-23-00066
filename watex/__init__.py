ðŸ’§ A machine learning research package for hydrogeophysic 
===========================================================

:code:`watex` stands for *WAT-er EX-ploration*. Its packages and modules are 
written to solve real-engineering problems in the field of groundwater 
exploration (GWE). Currently, it deals with the differents methods below: 
    
    * `geophysical (from DC-Electrical to Electromagnetic)` 
    * `hydrogeology (from drilling to parameters calculation)`
    * `geology (for stratigraphic model generation)`
    * `predicting permeability coefficient (k), flow rate and else` 
    
All methods mainly focus on GWE field. One of the main advantage using `WATex`_ 
is the application of machine learning methods in the hydrogeophysic parameter 
predictions. It contributes to minimize the risk of unsucessfull drillings and 
the hugely reduce the cost of the hydrogeology parameter collections.

# take care of potential over-subcription performance issues, in sections of

# the inner OpenMP runtime to temporarily disable it while under the scope of
# the outer OpenMP parallel section.
